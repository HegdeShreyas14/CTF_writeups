# Filter Maze 

- The question provided 2 files lwe_pub_params.json and graph.json along with the python file which outlines the working of the maze

- We know values of n,m,q and graph points frmo graph.json
- To get to the flag, need to get the correct hamiltonian path so that key can be obtained
-Can try a bruteforce script to find the path, the question also talks about PoW script as well
- Question files have `lwe` written

- need to run a script to get the errors mags and the secret hamiltonian path

- since lwe was previously mentioned, the equation would be b=As+e(mod q).
